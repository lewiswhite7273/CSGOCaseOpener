# CSGOCaseOpener
This programs goal is to be able to simulate a weapon case opening like seen in CSGO.
The program will feature reading and writing to a file, exception handling, and will also include a class for the cases.

First the program will greet the user and state the rarities.
The user will be asked which cases are to be picked, and how many.
The main class will call on the "case" class, and inside that will be all of the possible cases and their possible weapons to be opened.
For every weapon opened, it will be written to the file "opened"
The user will be able to see all of the weapons they have opened ever, if they choose to do so.
The entire program will include exception handling for all possible errors.
